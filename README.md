# HelloCrypto
Can be used by any organisation for the lucky draw of the events. Tech Stack: Java, Spring, Struts2, Hibernate (or JPA), MySQL, HTML, jQuery, Ajax, Crypto. Web part uses Struts2 as the Controller to handle the requests, and Rest part uses Spring RestController to handle the requests. Target to use the encryption and decryption (here is asymmetric encryption such as RSA) for the lucky draw. End users publish their public key, and the admin uses some of the public keys to encrypt the content, then publishes the encrypted message. As the end users have the  key pair, private key and public key, so the end users who can use their private key to decrypt the message and get the correct content win the lucky draw.
